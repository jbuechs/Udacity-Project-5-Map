# Udacity Nanodegree Project 5: Neighborhood Map Project
Project 5 for the Udacity Front End Web Developer Nanodegree

##How to Run the Application
You can access the application in a couple of ways:

1. Clone the GitHub repository at https://github.com/jbuechs/Udacity-Project-5-Map.git and open index.html
2. Go to http://jbuechs.github.io/Udacity-Project-5-Map/

##About this Project
For this project, I created a responsive web application that shows users some of my favorite places in Madrid. Users can search by name, click on the list of names, or click on the map markers. The search field filters the names and markers as the user types his/her search.

This was my first time creating an app with ajax requests and it was frustrating and educational. I definitely need more practice programming with asynchronous functions!
